## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I have started learning to code by doing a web development course and wanted to do some projects to practice the HTML and CSS skills I have aquired so far. The main thing I have learned is how to use the flexbox for layout.

### Continued development

I want to continue doing more projects to practice what I have learned. This being my first project outside of the personal webisites I created following my course it took quite a long time and I am hoping to see if I can complete my next project quicker! I would also like to learn more about the flexbox.
